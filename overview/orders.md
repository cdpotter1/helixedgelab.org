## How it works:

* Check out [<mark style="color:red;">**Pricing Information**</mark>](pricing.md)
* **Prepare any artwork / design / wording** that will be included in your project. _(Please note that, although we can prepare your images for laser cutting, printing, etc., our ability to create or design your artwork for you is limited. Providing us with an image or design will greatly expedite the process!)_&#x20;
  * Submit designs as: Adobe Illustrator, .pdf, .jpeg, or Google Doc
* Fill out the [<mark style="color:red;">**Order Request Form**</mark>](https://forms.gle/ZnFa9Z53RwzcnbB68)
* Please **allow 3-10 days for orders** to be fulfilled (depending on type of project, quantity of items, current volume of requests, staffing, etc.) _Please note that holidays and the end-of-the-term are generally particularly busy, and wait times might be longer._&#x20;
