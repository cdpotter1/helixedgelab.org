**The EDGE Lab is open to all students and staff, and we invite you to come try your hand at "making!" For sticker & button requests, especially, we encourage you (or a TA, athlete, club member) to visit the lab and follow our** [**easy self-guided tutorials**](../getting-started/tutorials-how-to/)**!  :)**&#x20;

For more information on placing an order (posters, laser engraving, heat transfers, buttons, stickers, or custom projects), please see below. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## How it works:

* Check out [<mark style="color:red;">**Pricing Information**</mark>](pricing.md)
* **Prepare any artwork / design / wording** that will be included in your project. _(Please note that, although we can prepare your images for laser cutting, printing, etc., our ability to **design** artwork for you is limited. Providing us with an image or design will greatly expedite the process!)_&#x20;
  * Submit designs as: Adobe Illustrator, .pdf, .jpeg, or Google Doc
* Fill out the [<mark style="color:red;">**Order Request Form**</mark>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwU-Q0RLCMK-x_vxx5x3ejBMF7FD7ZZw1uj6EXJPSTFrMAZg/viewform?usp=sharing\&ouid=103208705210319003698)
* Please **allow 3-10 days for orders** to be fulfilled (depending on type of project, quantity of items, current volume of requests, staffing, etc.) _Please note that holidays and the end-of-the-term are generally particularly busy, and wait times might be longer._&#x20;
