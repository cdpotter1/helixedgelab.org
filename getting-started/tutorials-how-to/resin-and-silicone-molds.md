# ♟ Resin (& Silicone Molds)

### **Step One: Silicone Mold**

1. Measure the object that you’ll be making a mold of.
2. You’re going to be making a foam “frame” to hold the object. Measure & cut out 4 foam board walls that are ½” taller than the object and a floor that is ½” wider than the object. Neat, even cuts will make it easier to create a secure frame.&#x20;

3. Using hot glue, construct the walls of the frame, making sure that each wall hangs slightly over the corner edge (the walls should not be flush). USE A LOT OF GLUE, around all seams - inside and out - so that the silicone won’t leak from your frame.&#x20;

4. Lay your frame on a plate and fill the enclosure with water to test for leaks. Seal any leaks with more hot glue.
5. Apply a thin layer of glue to the bottom of your object and stick it to the floor of your box. Your object should not be touching the walls of the frame.
6. **Spray your item with mold release** (this makes it easier to remove from the mold).
7. Mixing the silicone:
   1. Pour Part A into one container, and Part B into another container. Stir each solution.
   2. Mix equal parts A and B into a third container. Stir well. Once mixed, you have about 45 minutes to use the solution before it starts to harden.
8. Pour the A/B mixture slowly and evenly into the frame so that it completely surrounds & covers your item.
9. Let sit for 5 - 6 hours to allow your mold to set
10. Peel off the foam walls and remove your item from the silicone mold. (Depending on the shape of the item, you may need to make a slit in the mold.)

### **Step Two: UV Resin**

1. If you’re adding color to your resin, mix desired color into the clear UV resin. Your color should NOT be too opaque, as this complicates the curing process.
2. If you had to cut your mold, wrap a couple of rubber bands around outside to keep it pulled together (but not too tight; it shouldn’t squeeze the mold)
3. Spray the inside of your silicone mold with mold release
4. Pour the resin into your mold slowly and evenly to minimize bubbles. (There will be some small bubbles, but you don’t want large ones.)
5. Shine the UV light on all sides of the mold (30 - 60 seconds per side) to cure the resin. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow it to cool.
6. Pull your finished design from the mold! :)
