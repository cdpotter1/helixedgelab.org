# MakerBot Replicator+

**Download the File to Print**

Download an .stl file to print. It can be something you created using CAD software such as Tinkercad or a file you found on a website like thingiverse.com

**The Printer Software**

The MakerBot has a large print bed ideal for printing larger 3D models. It requires a bit of setup on the printer and software to start printing:

1. Turn on the MakerBot by flipping the switch on the left back side
2. Locate the MakerBot Print app on the computer and open it.

3. When MakerBot Print opens you will see the print bed and the available printing space represented by the box around the print bed. The model must fit inside the print space or the MakerBot will not be able to print it. If the model does not fit, it will need to be resized.
4. Go to **File->Insert File**. When the dialog box appears, open the file you downloaded and the model will load into MakerBot Print.

**Sizing the Model**

1. Once your model loads, check that it fits inside the printing space. If any part of the model is outside the printing space, the model must be resized:
   1. Click on the model.
   2. Click the **Scale** button ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/rlApOcTMJ6osHiVsdwyWb3NMtiJVG4QpcMQVQLU1hpIxFcrsxA7WV5qMURYNfXskKo9Q4z4ugK3iWSK6xFB71WOrza3WYXqhdPRBGVmaV39kCKFAH1USBgXbmiOviJLtdFFJqcH4Db09EWy2-d4WqQ), and make sure that the **Uniform Scaling** box is checked to keep the proportions of the model.
   3. To shrink the model, you can decrease the dimensions of the side you want to change, in millimeters, or change the percent to a number lower than 100. Since the Uniform Scaling box is checked, changing one dimension will change the rest. Shrink the model until it is completely in the print space.
2. If there is still some room in the printing space, you can also make the model bigger. Just go to Scale and increase the dimension or percent, making sure that all of the model stays within the printing space.
3. Once the model is the right size, you have to set up the printer.

**Setting Up the Printer**

1. Check that the MakerBot Print software has recognized the printer. The rectangle at the bottom right corner of the screen should display **MakerBot Replicator+**. If this is not the case, click the rectangle and click the Select button next to MakerBot Replicator+. The printer has now been selected. Click the rectangle again to minimize it.

2. Click the **Gear Icon** ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wfsV3u4Zfhpw7c9nUtCpsP1MzFeraPhNGSAYZO\_MHpI-4WLteXyEeQ9RiMLRtZ5MrWWkTLpFG0WuZPLZ9dC4nM77e23--zNGd9NTNHfZNYqLuaGeUC6NgZKJo-YsyXpGMmnwNs7xy1SSyaYMNQ1UcQ)on the right side of the screen. This will open the Printer settings.
3. Set the **Support Density** to 10% and set the **Support Type** to Breakaway (PLA) Support. Everything else should be left as is.

4. Press the **Preview** button ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XUr4tH1OA5qurl\_VMuFq-OvkGyQYcrzpkh7Sagorus8IflYOpXpARDQgoX6xPhRChMOh-R74zxk1iRmSZK23InvxK631MEYJtuGSWFa\_UZDghmdQJU23frpLNqsxNwp9bQGfRqmg07EBIZLAJVnEqg)to see how long it will take to print the model. Once the printer has calculated the print time, check with the Edge Lab Facilitator to make sure that it is ok to print, as there might not be enough time left in the day.
5. If the Edge Lab Facilitator says it is ok, click the red **Print** button at the lower right corner of the screen. The model will be sent to the printer and will start to print as soon as the printhead heats up.
6. As the model is being printed, check back on it periodically to make sure nothing has gone wrong while printing. If an error occurs, press the **Pause** button on the printer to stop the print. Inform the Edge Lab Facilitator so that he/she can help you fix the problem.&#x20;

**Unloading the Print**

When your print is done the printer will beep, ask for a scrapper and take the print out of the print bed by carefully scrapping in between the print bed and the model. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable doing this ask the Edge Lab facilitator for help.

Delete your model from MakerBot Print by clicking the model and pressing the **Delete** key on the keyboard then close MakerBot Print.

**Loading and Unloading Filament**

If the MakerBot is out of filament or if you want to use a different color filament, follow these steps.

**Unloading**

1. Use the dial on the MakerBot to select **Filament** then select **Unload Filament**.
2. The printhead will heat up (this will take a few minutes).
3. Once the printhead reaches the correct temperature, the motors will start to withdraw the filament. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove the filament.
4. Retract the filament through the guide tube by manually spinning the filament spool, then pull up the filament panel and remove the spool.

**Loading**

1. Pull up the filament panel at the top (back) of the printer
2. Insert the new spool into the compartment
3. Feed the end of the filament through the guide tube until it comes out the other end.
4. Use the dial on the MakerBot to select **Filament** then select **Load Filament**.
5. The printhead will heat up (this will take a few minutes).
6. Once the printhead reaches the correct temperature, follow the instructions on the screen to insert the filament.
7. Once the filament is extruded press the dial on the printer.
