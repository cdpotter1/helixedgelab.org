# MakerBot Sketch

**Download the File to Print**

Download an .stl file to print. It can be something you created using CAD software such as Tinkercad or a file you found on a website like thingiverse.com.



**The Printer Software**

The MakerBot Sketch has a small print bed ideal for printing small 3D models. It requires a bit of setup on the printer and software to start printing

1. Turn on the MakerBot Sketch by flipping the switch on the right side.
2. Locate the MakerBot Print app on the computer and open it.

3. When MakerBot Print opens you will see the printing bed and the available printing space represented by the box around the print bed. The model must fit inside the print space or the MakerBot Sketch will not be able to print it. If the model does not fit, it will need to be resized.
4. Go to **File->Insert File**. When the dialog box appears, open the file you downloaded and the model will be loaded into MakerBot Print.

**Sizing the Model**

1. Once the model loads, check that it is all inside the printing space. If any part of the model is outside the printing space, the model must be resized.&#x20;
   1. Click on the model.
   2. Click the **Scale** button ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oa9c4w0x2fNvUTR6WsH82JwGZYx8RQR72weA9lFTZM4VhXFnnPMaVHyYbz4AvqJpg8cIUyEBp8nsIkXd6CnufTpq1CaaghWMAA7LcvAlfSytjCLmC6ccgbdVkwXiAx\_Qqljgct0AGlfHICIYiqnH9Tk) and make sure that the **Uniform Scaling** box is checked to keep the proportions of the model.
   3. To shrink the model, you can decrease the dimensions of the side you want to change, in millimeters, or change the percent to a number lower than 100. Since the Uniform Scaling box is checked, changing one dimension will change the rest. Shrink the model until it is completely in the print space.
2. If there is still some room in the printing space, you can make the model bigger. Just go to **Scale** and increase the dimension or percent, making sure that all of the model stays within the printing space.
3. Once the model has been resized, you have to set up the printer.

**Setting Up the Printer**

1. Make sure that the MakerBot Print software has recognized the MakerBot Sketch printer. The rectangle at the bottom right corner of the screen should display **MakerBot Sketch**. If this is not the case, click the rectangle and click the **Select** button next to MakerBot Sketch. The printer has now been selected. Click the rectangle again to minimize it.

2. Click the **Gear Icon** ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qD74msQex-P9gOS6\_1fmBqezp7XO2XpoUau\_AMCqVwKDWzCxoPEXkBDeOvg7ter2fKTk1qC8p3lGhxtClqnMILDEEBN9-ZDNHQcqVVJxU6JWY-XUf3NHpnOlTETjgLpSbmmmm\_nkq78GDhRz2kAwnX8)on the Right side of the screen. This will open the Printer settings.
3. Click the **Custom Settings** button.
4. A window will appear with the default settings. Click **Custom Setting** one more time.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/k\_W9TJWkZii\_X6NCbBZ-VnEBCKTBOINSzdc4s8Boy1z\_-5e3DMrXOYWBF3JFThSgdf5y\_Iw77IhmkG9x9h8\_NVDCAp7gBZOa2uxMm5VI8IOFPciI60MoVBqiFY2kV8JpUXyWtL0-744ULR28DAA1Duk)
5. The Custom Print Modes window will appear. Select the **Sketch Settings** under Custom Print Modes then click **Done**
6. Press the **Preview** button ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wbixluc512SqUlGB80mipzqX8zRM5iWz-23ZN6vjUbrgRQ5NlqdigStnQHQQnmqta37q\_PCk6zff9d-GMynPh2nnVA5ur70JZ92HbuSHuF0kEHR2OC4sDYKwnHKA4T-2-C0nvis0d1l3qOEfqJ89l30)and the printer will estimate how long it will take to print the model. Once the printer has calculated the print time, inform the Edge Lab Facilitator to make sure that it is ok to print, as there might not be enough time left in the day.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MJQhT4\_5AjXpLkwoPQV9h7If\_KQQZoiB5cFV5q-LrUoxnUesNPkAl0Vi4sqVm3tGi4s8GmUVG1\_MjvQvyZnkt0XphH286rki\_e6221Ww4bDKaLjul1zX\_BzEUaOe8tOUntYS-Mdw6m3mPl\_bDwry53c)
7. If the Edge Lab Facilitator says it is ok, plug a flash drive into the computer and click the red **Export** button on the lower right corner of the screen. A window will pop up asking where to save the file. Select the flash drive, and name your file.
8. Once the file is saved onto the flash drive, remove the flash drive from the computer and plug it in to the MakerBot Sketch 3D printer.
9. On the 3D printer's touch screen, select **Print**. Then select the flash drive icon and, when the files show up, press the play icon next to you print. The printer will start to print your model.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Xcq91v4auldd3GXxsRy\_kmj3NARl7d4fRJSxSH2vXtVIh30W\_iqdXn75X91L2fRE0qTgH4-V1kPcNHHe5pl4H2B6GYT\_-b1psBv5juGjZq0Zg58Nsc3n\_QVWKGGfqIT8VvFNjWgrTqOWhshy7koGisI)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/alPRhgl23jw\_rNim0T0lbyWwySHRE-OJDa2XpiquUdkKLPB-GkmgF9C8i8mxNmIADZYxX8C2wHoZyrTF8kVRE22MYQj-AG3mchMCLh6\_jZh4zzqmvkEMJiYZ5tAWqzyVQCo6Fl19-zsgXIeI40LMbm8)![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CsXHHrqQN27yeUhBWHHbhfQ3aGHKCfPskSkq5Jq5eEqp2Uv2oIlG1XG-SE2c1d8NTx98huEIcKMxBBhIrOIgy2h5K97oiN4KStNfFg4r5zHXaEq3NXuGy3SxtZbWKEr-fzxDYT5icL-\_KJqZFAzCSPQ)

**Unloading the Print**

1. When your print is done the printer will beep. Ask for a scraper and take the print out of the print bed by carefully scraping between the print bed and the model. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable doing this, ask the Edge Lab Facilitator for help.
2. Delete your model from MakerBot Print by clicking the model and pressing the **Delete** key on the keyboard. Then close MakerBot Print.
3. If you are unable to stay during the whole time that the model is printing, inform the Edge Lab Facilitator so that they can check the print while you are gone to make sure nothing goes wrong or to take the model out once it is done.
4. Once the model has been removed from the printer it will have some excess material that you will have to take off.

**Loading and Unloading Filament**

If the MakerBot Sketch is out of filament or if you want to use a different color filament, follow these steps:

**Unloading**

1. On the touch screen of the MakerBot Sketch, select **Material;** then select **Unload Filament**.
2. The printhead will heat up (this will take a few minutes).
3. Once the printhead is at the correct temperature, the motors will start to withdraw the filament. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove the filament.
4. Once the filament has been fully removed, gently pull off the filament door and remove the spool.

**Loading**

1. Remove the filament door
2. Use only PLA filament
3. Insert the spool into the compartment
4. On the touch screen of the MakerBot Sketch, select **Material,** then select **Load Filament**.
5. The printhead will heat up (this will take a few minutes).
6. Once the printhead is at the correct temperature, follow the instructions on the screen to load the filament.
7. Once the filament is extruding, press **Next** on the touch screen.
