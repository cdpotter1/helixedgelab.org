Download an .stl file to print. It can be something you created using CAD software such as Tinkercad or a file you found on a website like thingiverse.com\


**The Printer Software**

The LulzBot has a big print bed ideal for printing larger 3d models. It requires a bit of setup on the printer and software to start printing.

1. Turn on the LulzBot by flipping the switch on the front of the printer
2. Locate the Cura LulzBot software on the computer and open it ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/486ezAbXMuaK37b1qpJYymZRfgGw54DNOf9DJK5ziO691liXQ58L0Cov2tb8K3z2Cn\_10gufy6D089YF0OmPXfnxjNxhw-Exn7cFJHkb1r4BBF9hsJt9eh3Y5JvRwFGn3R-nXYE9Wd9yEXpmtQD1iQ)
3. When Cura opens you will see the print bed and the available printing space represented by the box around the print bed. The model must fit inside the print space or the LulzBot will not be able to print it. If the model does not fit, it will need to be resized.

1. Go to **File->Open File**. When the dialog box appears, open the file you downloaded and the model will be loaded onto the software.

**Sizing the Model**

Once your model loads, check that it fits inside the printing space. If any part of the model is outside the printing space, the model must be resized. Also: you must check that the model is not going beneath the print bed, as this will cause the LulzBot to move the printhead into the print bed which will crack the print bed and make the printer unusable.

1. Start by checking the position of the model. Click on the model and three arrows should appear.

2. The **move** option will be highlighted on the left side of the screen. **Make sure that the Z position is set to zero**. The X and Y positions can be set to any value as long as they keep the model inside the print bed. It is recommended that the X and Y positions are also set to zero if only one model is being printed to keep it at the center of the build plate, but it is not necessary.
3. To resize the model, select the **Scale** option under **Move**, and the arrows will turn to cubes. You can resize the model by dragging the cubes or by changing the size or percentage on the Scale option.

5. Once the model has been resized, you have to set up the printer.

**Setting Up the Printer**

1. In the upper right corner you will see the **Material** option. Leave that as is, as the setting should be correct for the filament that is currently on the printer.
2. Click on the **Monitor** tab, then under **Manual** **Control** click the **Connect** button to have the software connect to the LulzBot. Once the software is connected, the top of the screen will display: **Connected via USB**

3. Click on the **Prepare** tab, and make sure that the **Print Setup** is set to **Custom**.
4. Under **Infill**, set the **infill density to 10%**

5. Under **Support**, make sure the **Generate Support** box is checked on and set the support density to **5%**

**Printing the Model**

1. Look at the estimated print time at the bottom right of the screen, and check with the Edge Lab Facilitator to make sure that it is ok to print, as there might not be enough time left in the day.
2. If the Edge Lab Facilitator says the print time is ok, set the button next to the print time so that it reads **Print via USB** instead of Save to File.
3. Look under the **Material** option. If there is a message prompting you to use glue, grab a glue stick and place a small layer of glue on the print bed on the area that the model will print.
4. Press the **Print via USB** button, and the print bed and the printhead will begin to heat.
5. Once the LulzBot is ready to print, it will begin by calibrating itself and cleaning the printhead. Once it starts to print, check back on the model periodically to make sure nothing has gone wrong while printing. If an error occurs, press the **Pause** button at the bottom right of the screen and then press Abort Print. Inform the Edge Lab Facilitator, so that he/she can help you fix the problem.&#x20;

**Unloading the Print**

1. When your print is done the printer will beep and the print bed will slide forward. Ask for a scraper and take the print off of the print bed by carefully scraping in between the print bed and the model. If you donâ€™t feel comfortable doing this, ask the Edge Lab facilitator for help.
2. Delete your model from the software by clicking the model and pressing the Delete key on the keyboard. Then close the software.
3. If you are unable to stay during the whole time that the model is printing, inform the Edge Lab Facilitator so that they can check the print while you are gone to make sure nothing goes wrong or  to take the model out once it is done.
4. Once the model has been removed from the printer it will have some excess material that you will have to take off

**Loading and Unloading Filament**

If the LulzBot is out of filament or if you want to use a different color filament, follow these steps.

**Unloading**

1. Click the **Monitor** tab.
2. Click the **Connect** button under **Manual** control.
3. Click the **Preheat** button under **Hot End**. The printhead will heat up, and the target temperature will be displayed on the right.
4. Unlike the other machines, the LulzBot does not make a sound once it is ready, so you have to monitor the temperature on the screen. Once it reaches the target temperature, the printhead is hot enough to start withdrawing the filament.
5. Set the **Extrusion** amount to **30**.
6. Click the **Retract** button to start withdrawing the filament. The LulzBot only withdraws a certain amount of filament at a time so the **Withdraw** button has to be pressed several times before all the filament is withdrawn. **DO NOT** press the Retract buttons several times at once. Wait for the LulzBot to stop retracting before pressing the button again.
7. Once all the filament has left the motor, unhinge the guiding rail and gently pull the filament out.
8. Cut off the tip of the filament so that there is no stringy filament hanging from it and you only have the solid filament.
9. Roll the filament back onto the spool and remove the spool from the holder of LulzBot.\


**Loading**

1. Place the new spool on the holder of the LulzBot.
2. Feed the end of the filament through the guide tube until it comes out the other end.
3. Click the **Prepare** tab
4. Select the correct filament type from the **Material** option
5. Look at the thickness of the material as that will determine which profile you have to choose in the **Profile** option. **If the thickness is 2.85mm then select Standard. If the thickness is 1.75mm then select Standard 1.75**
6. Click the **Monitor** tab. Click the **Connect** button under Manual control.
7. Click the **Preheat** button under **Hot End**. The printhead will heat up, and the target temperature will be displayed on the right.
8. Unlike the other machines, the LulzBot does not make a sound once it is ready, so you have to monitor the temperature on the screen. Once it reaches the target temperature, the printhead is hot enough to start extruding the filament.
9. Set the **Extrusion** amount to **50**.
10. Unhinge the guiding rail and guide the filament into the motor.
11. Once the filament is on the motor, close the hinge.
12. Press the **Extrude** button. The LulzBot only extrudes a certain amount at a time so press the extrude button until filament starts to come out of the print head.  **DO NOT** press the Extrude buttons several times at once. Wait for the LulzBot to stop extruding before pressing the button again.

**Creating New Material Profiles**

By default, the LulzBot is set to use filament of 2.85mm thickness, but you are also able to use material with thickness of 1.75mm. If you want to use material that is 1.75mm thick you have to make a Custom Profile (if there is not one created already) as the preset profiles have the material thickness set to 2.85mm. You only have to create a new profile once per material.

1. Under the **Profile** tab select the **Manage Profiles** option

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Gx46wgn-tzWjXryTukLKpG3\_NrrVTR0dZR3WCSe8-8KDoJbHEbbt0C\_QlCKTqDpq70mIRzDf47xugB4uJ8fQ4OlBlpBbyeaFyt6SIPBqJI6VgqvQBigIo3E3xXYooWeEYIEYtn06StZSd2Ed8DLGyQ)

2. When the Profiles window pops up select the **Standard** profile and then click the **Duplicate** button.
3. When asked for the name it is suggested that you name it **Standard 1.75mm. T**hat way it is easy to identify that it is the standard profile for 1.75mm thick material. Then click **ok**
4. Close the Profile window then select the new profile from the **Profile** options.
5. In the **Material** tab under **Print Setup**, **change the Diameter from 2.85 to 1.75.** Go back to the  **Profile** options and select **Update** profile with current setting/overrides to save the changes.
