# ðŸ¤– Welcome to the EDGE Lab!

## About the Lab

The EDGE Lab, a part of Helix's [CTE EDGE](https://www.helixcharter.net/domain/24) program, is a classroom makerspace where all students (and staff!) are encouraged to explore, create, and tinker! Check out our [**project gallery**](overview/project-gallery.md) to see some of the things students have made in the lab, and get started making with our [**easy-to-use tutorials**](getting-started/tutorials-how-to/)!

### **Our hours:**

* Monday - Thursday 7:15 a.m. - 3:45 pm.&#x20;
  * \[Classes are taught in the lab periods 1, 2, & 4 during Fall 2025]

Students are welcome to work in the lab before and after school, during breaks, or during free periods. Teachers interested in scheduling a class visit should contact Mrs. Potter for more info.

The maker lab is, primarily, a do-it-yourself space. We encourage you to use our [**self-guided tutorials**](getting-started/tutorials-how-to/) to learn how to make items and use the [**EDGE Lab equipment**](overview/equipment.md)**.**&#x20;

During ASPIRE hours, all making is FREE! During the school day, we charge for the cost of supplies. Pricing information can be found [**here**](overview/pricing.md)**.**&#x20;
